Hi! This is a simple blog where I'm planning to do CTF writeups and write about my thoughts whatever catches my interest at the moment. Right now I'm spending a lot of time learning math, programming in Solidity, rust, and binary exploitation. 

In terms of CTF challenges I'm generally focused on binary exploitation and reverse engineering, but I will do the occasional web or cryptography challenge that piques my curiousity.

Originally this page was hosted at [this link](https://asatpathy314.github.io/ctf-writeups/). It's now hosted on Cloudflare Pages because I don't like GitHub Pages and the blog was due for a refactor.

## Tech Stack

This theme is written in vanilla JavaScript (+ TypeScript for type checking) and a little bit of ReactJS for some interactions. TailwindCSS is used for styling; and Markdown for blog contents. This site is partially based on this [repo](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).
